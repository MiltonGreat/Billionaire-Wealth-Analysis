# Billionaire-Wealth-Analysis

### Overview

This project investigates the wealth distribution, industry representation, and geographical concentration of billionaires using two comprehensive datasets. By analyzing demographic and financial data, it reveals patterns in wealth creation, highlights economic disparities, and explores the transformative role of industries like technology and finance.

### Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze two datasets containing billionaire information to provide meaningful insights into:

- Wealth distribution trends.
- Industry representation.
- Geographical concentration of billionaires.
- Age demographics and trends.
- Economic disparities among billionaires.

### Problem Statement

The global concentration of wealth among billionaires presents a complex picture of economic influence and disparities. The project aims to uncover insights into how billionaire wealth is distributed, what industries drive wealth creation, and how demographic factors like age and gender play a role. Understanding these dynamics is essential for addressing wealth inequality and informing policy decisions.

### Datasets

#### Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023)

Contains statistics on the world’s billionaires, including:
- Name, age, gender, and country.
- Net worth and sources of wealth.
- Industries and companies.

Total wealth represented: $12.2 trillion.
Total entries: 2,640 billionaires.

#### Global Billionaire Wealth Dataset (2002-2023)

Covers trends over two decades, allowing temporal analysis. Includes:
- Names, annual incomes, and industries.
- Geographic data (country, city).
  
Information on wealth origins (self-made vs. inherited).

### Solution Approach

1. Data Cleaning:
- Imputed missing values in attributes like age and income.
- Addressed outliers in net worth and age (e.g., capped ages between 18–101).
- Standardized features for comparability.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Examined wealth distribution using line plots and box plots.
- Analyzed billionaire demographics (age, gender) and geographic concentration with scatter plots and interactive maps.
- Correlation heatmaps to uncover relationships between financial and demographic features.

3. Feature Engineering:
- Grouped industries to identify dominant sectors.
- Created wealth concentration metrics (e.g., wealth share of the top 10% vs. median billionaires).

4. Insights Derivation:
- Highlighted shifts in billionaire demographics over two decades.
- Identified trends in wealth accumulation during global crises (2008, COVID-19 pandemic).

### Key Findings

#### Wealth Distribution:

- The wealthiest 10% control an average net worth of $21.84 billion, nearly five times the overall average of $4.62 billion.
- The top 10 billionaires collectively represent $911.3 billion, accounting for 7.47% of total wealth.

#### Demographic Insights:

- Average billionaire age: 65.1 years.
- Youngest billionaire: Clemente Del Vecchio (18 years).
- Female billionaires constitute less than 10%, primarily inheriting wealth.

#### Industry Trends:

- Technology, finance, and retail dominate. Tech billionaires are younger, driven by innovation.

#### Geographical Trends:

- Cities like New York, San Francisco, and Beijing are key hubs.

The U.S. and China lead in billionaire wealth, while emerging markets like India and Brazil show growth.
